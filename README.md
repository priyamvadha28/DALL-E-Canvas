# DALL-E-Canvas

A web application that allows users to generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E model. It features a lightweight Flask backend to handle API requests and an HTML/JavaScript frontend for user interaction and displaying the generated images.

**Features:**

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Input a text prompt and generate multiple images based on your description.
- **Flask Backend:** A Python Flask server handles the communication with the OpenAI API.
- **Dynamic Image Display:** Generated images are dynamically loaded and displayed on the web page.
- **Loading Indicator:** A visual loading animation is shown while images are being generated.
- **Responsive Design:** Uses Bootstrap for a basic responsive layout.

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+:** Download from python.org.
- **OpenAI API Key:** You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use the DALL-E model. Obtain one from the OpenAI Platform.

**Installatiom:**

Clone the Repository (or create the files):
If you have this code in a Git repository, clone it. Otherwise, create a new directory (e.g., dalle-canvas) and organize your files as follows:

    dalle-canvas/
    ├── app.py
    ├── .env
    └── templates/
        └── index.html

Save the Python code as app.py.

Create a folder named templates inside dalle-canvas/.

Save the HTML code as index.html inside the templates/ folder.

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal (dalle-canvas/) and create a virtual environment:

    python -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:

    .\venv\Scripts\activate

Your terminal prompt should show (venv) at the beginning, indicating the virtual environment is active.

Install the required Python packages:

    pip install openai flask python-dotenv

**Usage:**

- Activate your virtual environment.
- Run the Flask application:
    'python app.py'
  You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running, typically on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ or http://0.0.0.0:8080/.
- Access the application, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/.
- To generate images:
  - Enter a descriptive prompt in the text field.
  - Click the "Submit" button.
  - A loading animation will appear, and once the images are generated by DALL-E, they will be displayed on the page.
